# Diabetes-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the risk of diabetes using a dataset that includes various health metrics, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and age. The goal is to build a logistic regression model to classify individuals at risk of diabetes and evaluate its performance through visualizations like ROC curves.
